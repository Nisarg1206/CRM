Description of Project:
This project is a simple Contact Management App built with React and Redux for state management. It allows users to view, edit, and delete contact details such as name, email, and phone number. The app uses Material UI for styling and components like tables, forms, and buttons. Major technical decisions include using Redux for centralized state management and React's useState for local state in components. Each contact is displayed in a table, where users can edit or delete contacts using corresponding icons. On clicking "Edit", the form appears with the contact details pre-filled, and changes are saved upon submission. The app ensures a clean separation of concerns by using action creators and reducers to manage state updates.
